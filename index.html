  	<div id="tribute-info"><p><strong>Margaret Heafield Hamilton</strong> (born on August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist, systems engineer, and business owner. She is credited with coining the term "software engineering". Hamilton was Director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program. In 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for systems and software design.<br><br>

	Hamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports about the 60 projects and six major programs in which she has been involved.<br><br>

	Hamilton then joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which at the time was working on the Apollo space mission. She eventually led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab. Hamilton's team was responsible for developing in-flight software, which included algorithms designed by various senior scientists for the Apollo command module, lunar lander, and the subsequent Skylab. Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software which included the error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (AKA the Priority Displays) which Hamilton designed and developed. She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.<br><br>

	Her areas of expertise include systems design and software development, enterprise and process modelling, development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modelling and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties, open-architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection and recovery techniques, man-machine interface systems, operating systems, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management techniques.</p>

      		<p>Here's a list of Margaret Hamilton's Awards and Recognition:</p>
      		<li><strong>1986</strong> - She received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award by the Association for Women in Computing.[8] This award is given to individuals who have excelled in either (or both) of two areas: 1. Outstanding scientific and technical achievement and 2. Extraordinary service to the computing community through their accomplishments and contributions on behalf of women in computing.</li>
      		<li><strong>2003</strong> - She was given the NASA Exceptional Space Act Award for scientific and technical contributions. The award included $37,200, the largest amount awarded to any individual in NASA's history.</li>
      		<li><strong>2009</strong> - She received the Outstanding Alumni Award by Earlham College.</li>
      		<li><strong>2016</strong> - She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama, the highest civilian honor in the United States.</li>
      		<li><strong>2017</strong> - She received the Computer History Museum Fellow Award, which honors exceptional men and women whose computing ideas have changed the world.</li>
      		<li><strong>2017</strong> - A "Women of NASA" LEGO set went on sale featuring (among other things) mini-figurines of Hamilton, Mae Jemison, Sally Ride, and Nancy Grace Roman.</li>
      		<li><strong>2018</strong> - She was invested <em>honoris causa</em> by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia</li>
